We just got back from Christmas with my family in Florida. I was basically just going to be home for the weekend and then head out to Mexico for a business trip.

On Saturday evening, we had some exceedingly bad wind. It actually woke me up in the middle of the night and I thought to myself, "I hope nothing happens to my fence." Well, as they say, "knock on wood".

I woke up in the morning and looked out the bathroom window and couldn't see any issues, so I basically forgot about it. But an hour or so later Kepler started barking outside. He honestly doesn't bark a whole lot outside. Generally all we have to do is open the bathrooom window and call for Kepler and he quits barking and comes inside. So I went to the bathroom and called for him, but he kept barking. Weirdly, it sounded like it was coming from the inside of the house. 

I then realized he was at the front of the house. This was extra weird, as our back yard is fenced. I figured he just found a way through our gate or something and let him in and went back upstairs. A bit later he started barking again, and what do you know he was in the front again.

I went out to the back yard to check and here's what I saw:

It was actually not a very hard fix. Lori and I went to Lowe's and picked up stuff to make a temporary fence to cover the broken area. (I did check with my neighbor to make sure they were ok with it, with the promise that I'd fix it for real in the summer.)

After tearning down all the fallen over fencing and replacing with the temporary fencing this is what we came up with:

We were all done before noon on Sunday. It's far from perfect, but I'd say it isn't bad for a few hours work.
