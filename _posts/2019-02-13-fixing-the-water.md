This winter has been pretty harsh. We had several inches of snow, which is several inches more snow than what we normally have. With all that snow came freezing weather and I had some pipes burst.

We have a detached laundry room and garage. So they both easily get too cold and we get freezing issues. The first winter at our house I had a pipe burst in the garage. I ended up paying way too much for someone to fix it. Then the next winter the same pipe burst again. I ended up just capping off the pipes that burst, since they fed three water faucets on the outside of my garage and I don't need that many hoses. 

In the laundry room I also added a shutoff valve on the pipes leading to the garage. This way I could turn off the water to the garage when winter approached and not worry about the garage anymore.

This worked well, except that as I mentioned this winter has been harsh.
So late one evening Robin, a guy living at our house, woke me up saying that the water was filling the laundry room. I ran outside and shot off all the water to the house.

Here is a picture of the burst pipe:

I was also pretty impressed that the faucet itself also burst -- and burst pretty bad! (Please excuse the nasty water in the sink.)

I didn't get a picture of it, but I ended up capping off (again) the pipes going to the garage and using a sharkbit slip coupling on the burst pipe. I bought a new faucet, but I haven't hooked it back up yet.

I also hooked up a heater to a homemade thermostat relay that my dad gave me. So that the heater would turn on whenever the ambient temperature in the laundry room would go below 37 degrees.

It isn't finished. The line to the garage is still capped off. So I can't use the hose. When it warms up a bit I'll fix that. My plan is to remove all the copper piping that I can and replace it with Pex. I just need to learn about Pex between now and then.
