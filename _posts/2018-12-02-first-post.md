I want to do more with my life than the 40 hour grind followed by Netflix and chill. I want to always be learning. To teach myself new skills. I want to know and understand more things. To be able to look back and see that I’ve made progress toward these goals.

To that end I will use this medium to document my projects. Maybe I’ll build something new in the garage, maybe I’ll write a new program, or maybe I’ll teach myself a new subject. (Probably, I’m doing all three at once). Along the way, I’ll document the process and discuss what I learned.

Keeping things documented will help me stay motivated to finish projects, but it will also provide a place I can look back and remind myself that I have been growing along the way. Along the way if I inspire someone to learn and grow then that’ll be great!
